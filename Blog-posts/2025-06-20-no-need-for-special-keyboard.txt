I have used mechanical keyboard for several months now
 and I still cannot get used to it
I do not type that much
 I am more of a thinker
so I do not need to have a custom keyboard
 no need for custom 200 Euro keyboard
I recently watched a video about Dynamicland and about Folk-computer
 and both of them use Bluetooth keyboard
the similar to the one I am typing from
 a Logitech one
that costs 35 Euro
 the one that survived my lovely kids
the one that lasts on initial batteries for two years now
