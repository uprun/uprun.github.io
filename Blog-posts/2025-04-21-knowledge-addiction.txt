I have knowledge addiction
it first started with wikipedia
I remember how I opened an article there and 
then I opened another one 
and then another one
rabbit hole goes very deep
hmm by the way how deep are rabbit holes
.. just kidding
I already know that , but the original idea comes from another video 
that I watched on youtube

by the way I have an addiction to youtube as well
it took me about 3 years to finally deal with it
at least I hope I dealt with it.

it was Not short-content videos
it was 10-25 minutes long videos
and all of them were full of knowledge
interesting but repetitive 

this kept my brain intertained in my hobby time,
but I did not make any progress on hobbies

since the time I cut youtube-watching I started to write

these essays are like bottles with letters
floating in the digital ocean.

Writing helps me to organise my thoughts.
I write first draft
then revisit it
- remove irrelevant paragraphs
- simplify the language
- condense the thought
- rethink the message.

These essays are a write-only minimalistic social media.
I limit full social media as well.

Conclusion:
I need to make stuff not only learn theory.
