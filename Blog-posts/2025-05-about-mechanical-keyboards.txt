so I started to type on mechanical keyboard
it really works nice up till the moment until I need to remove something
doing so with a pinky finger is hard, at least for me
and the next thing is typing something in upper case ..
 well that sucks like a lot
   I feel like I am making an accord on the guitar
       I do not enjoy clickiness of my keyboard anymore
          I might just go and reprogram it to fulfill my needs
    I think that it is cool to be able to type fast
      but the thing is that I am typing fast on my regular qwerty keyboard as well
I can even not look for a while on the screen and still enjoy typing
   like I diid one line before
     how would you know that I did not cheat
       well there is no really a way for you to check
      unless I make a video about it
  so final thoughts
    I like the ergonomic keyboard 
      but I need to reprogram it
  oh by the way I am ditching Visual studio code for my own editor.
    checkout web-editor on my github profile.
