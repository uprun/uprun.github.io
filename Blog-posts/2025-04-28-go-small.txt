scale down or go small
even better go tiny
  or tiny go you 
      Yoda-style
money show you a pain points
if something is expensive it means there is a demand
  demand is a fancy way to say that
       a lot of people need the same thing
I used to want the most fancy laptop
the most fancy phone
   but fancy does not mean quality
I never wrote an essay on my laptop
  I had my ergonomic keyboard for a year and ..
  I did not use it ... until my son decided to play 
   to play with my ergonomic keyboard
     and I allowed him
        and then I decided I will give it another try

now I am writing an essay on my smartphone
 because smartphone is a computer after all
   well this is not that much of an essay after all
     it is a very small essay 
       but I enjoy the process of typing
     small essay is better than no essay at all
so .. 
if I cannot compete with big players
  I can go small
    Apple did it in their time
when they started IBM did not consider them seriously
so now I am trying crazy thing
   I want to be able to work as a programmer
     from my phone
maybe not for my daily job
   but for my personal projects I would try
I already can compile go-lang here
   I will see if I can do something more
I will re-visit my Lisperanto project
   now the main focus will be mobile

so tiny I will go and I will use a tiny go.
