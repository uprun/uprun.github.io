hello 
so today I implemented very simple http server in Go
  why is this important
because now I can leverage my web-skills
  I am good with JavaSript
and I am good with HTML 
  just yesterday I rediscovered Nano editor
but I am close to launching my own web-editor
  the principle is simple
for all my tools - they should 
  - be one screen of a smartphone large.

it is always a good idea to keep tools simple.
  even in communication,
    too many goals will ruin the thought.
