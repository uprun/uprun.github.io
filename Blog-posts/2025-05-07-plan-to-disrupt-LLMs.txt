I do not believe in LLMs
  I would like to make something much simpler
     something less expensive 
        less computationally expensive
I would like to have something as simple as a karate-training-post
    it simple reflect the force you apply from the other side
I want something similar 
   but for thoughts
     I want a reflection of a thought
it can be as weird as obviously stupid as "complete-the-sentence-task"
  like "Do you have <something>?"
     "Do you have an apple?"
        "Do you have a salat?"
           - "which <salat> ?"
             - "<salat> with falafel"
    lets see if it can work out.
