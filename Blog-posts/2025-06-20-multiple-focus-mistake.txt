Recently I started developing a new project
 a text editor
with a twist
 where each of the symbols has a time-stamp when it was created
so I can easily add collaboration into it
 and also it should have been done on the canvas
so I can easily pan around with open editors
 and with these two goals I already lost focus
I scrapped the project after 5 days
 the current rule for myself is to focus on one thing
and to spend at most 1 day on it
