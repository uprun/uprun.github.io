so digital garden
yeah
 this is kind of similar to a blog 
   or to twitter or to mastodon
as I already mentioned in some other essay
 I used to write in HTML (hyper-text-markup-language)
it was all nice but consumed a lot of energy
  and prevented me from actually writing
     and prevented me from seeing the text
        and prevented me from editing it
   so basically it prevented me a lot

so as simple as it can be I started to write in txt
   just simple text files
      even without the Markdown support

now I am happy
   now I write
     and I do this from a smartphone
       see other essays for details

I do not need a fancy blog
just a folder on a distributed version control system
   you see I like irony
never the less 
  digital garden means that essays are half-backed
and I will revisit them here and there
   I will "grow" them 
that is why it is a "garden"
  the term was NOT invented by me
and the idea also was not
   the idea is simple
 publish ASAP as-soon-as-possible
    and dont worry about the quality
       you can improve later.
