I wrote a blog-post some time ago...
and 200 out of 278 lines where dedicated to make it look nice ...
did I mention that this was HTML and JS ... 
I do not see the original text beneath all that markup anymore
for my not so good writing this is definetely an overkill
now I see beaty in compactness.
