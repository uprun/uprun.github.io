The key to excellence is re-visit.


I made over ten thousand notes that is 10k 
over a period of seven years
   it is also roughly 6 MB of data
  and I can barely remember anything
my brain got lazy
my brain does not get trained
   for a while I was in a write-only mode
the thing is to achive anything good I also need to 
    READ
yeah I know how weird I type
   but reading back stuff helps a lot
re-writing helps a lot as well
 that is why the key to excellence is RE-visit

also try to discuss the topic with other persons
  their questions will make your thought better
or at least you will be ready to tricky questions

PS.
for transfering backups of notes I use Bluetooth
I also use paper for note taking
