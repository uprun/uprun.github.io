Stay on topic
be focused.
Lets start.

So ...
I made an app
  notetaking app.

it all started with the idea
the idea of balancing time
time between my wife and learning

I wanted to do this automatically
.. to assign time tokens to categories
and whatever category had less time invested
.. should get my attention

you see the problem here .. right?

don't worry
.. I am still married .... to the same woman

what a stupid educated being I was

I guess that everyone in relationships knows 
knows that attention to your partner is the most critical
the most most critical time category
that should be on a **separate** Jira board that you attend daily.

"stay on topic"
this did not aged well right?

well every story need a pre-story for a context
people love stories
I love stories as well.


Why on Earth would you be interested in all these stories.
- I do not know but I hope it is a bit fun to read.
 - for me it is fun to write
- but I promise that in the end it will all build up in a big picture
  like a puzzle.

TLDR;
- start with the simplest version of the tool as possible;
- maybe start with pen and paper version first.
