If you cannot keep up with expectations maybe downgrade


- Dialog approach?
I always want to buy more fancy equipment... 
but the the thing is 
I do not need very fancy PC to start writing an essay


- I quit watching YouTube 
- I quit reading social media
- I quit drinking an alcohol

-- it looks like I can analyze whether I have an addiction
--- but it took me roughly 5 years to understand this
--- so the mentioned module is quite slow, but it works :D
---- I did not mention module before did not I
---- I actually did but in different essay

so what do I start with
I can start with an "dialog" mode
I change my thoughts quite often
One thing is to think thought and another is to talk
with communications comes clarity of thought
   and I can test ideas with people other than me
   I always need to test my ideas with real people
