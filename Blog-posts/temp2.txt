If you cannot keep up with expectations 
maybe downgrade


- Dialog approach?
I always want to buy more fancy equipment... 
but the the thing is 
I do not need very fancy PC to 
start writing an essay


- I quit watching YouTube for [1w 3d] already
- I quit reading social media for [1m] already
- I quit drinking alcohol for [6m] already
-- it looks like I can analyze whether 
   I have an addiction
--- but it took me roughly 5 years
    to understand this
--- so the mentioned module is quite slow, 
    but it works :D
---- I did not mention module before did not I
---- I actually did but in different essay

The idea is to follow rules, 
follow own rules 
up til the end
But sometimes you can just change them

I might revisit Lisperanto project
because AST is all I need
// AST is abstract syntax tree -
or a fancy way to say that I use Lego approach for
 programming


so what do I start with
I can start with an "dialog" mode
I change my thoughts quite often
One thing is to think thought and another is to talk
with communications comes clarity of thought
   and I can test ideas with people other than me
   I always need to test my ideas with real people
