do I really need a mech..
this what I typed and paused 
this is already an intriguing start of the blog
but
do I
do I really need a mechanical keyboard
split keyboard
with column layout
for even better ergonomics 
it is also a reduced size keyboard
this means that if I wanf to type special symbols
like numbers 
I need to press one of four "layer" buttons
in order to type them
...
also my keyboard does not have any markings
so I need to memorize the layout
but it is also useful
since I use two languages for my writings
why?
- what why?
- why it is useful?
- actually it just forces me to blind typing

and now I am half-sitting on the sofa in a very
ergonomic way
or almost ergonomic way
like in a bicycle where you half-sit half-lay
like a shezlong (lookup proper term here)
in front of a pool or in front of the sea

the keyboard is not exactly mandatory for
writing
 to start the process of writing
but for some weird reason
it brings a joy of typing
especially when I remember where to type
then my typing is like really really fast
you can see this by the amount of words
amount of words I use now and in the beginning
beginning of this blog
now it is more dense 
it is dense because I am warmed up now
and I can type much much faster
before it was fun to just type one symbol
for a very long time
like it took 20 second to find a key
but now it can be much much faster

so do you need a mechanical keyboard to start
to start a poem
to start a novel
to start an essay
to start a blog
to start a tweet  (yeah I am this old)
the answer is no
just start writing
enjoy clickiness of your ehmmm mechanical
mechanical keyboard :D
just keep your dignity while having fun.
