the things I learned after 7 years of app development for digital notes
or how I use physical notebook instead of my own app
today I finally configured ssh to access my github from Android tablet
I made over 10k notes and I can barely remember what I wrote yesterday
I became lazy
my brain does not get trained
10k notes is roughly 6MB of data I could just use physical notebook instead
before I used about 96 pages of A5 format for 1 year of notes 
with physical notes I do not worry about not-suffcient screen brightness during bright day
I do not worry about the fact that I will need electricity to access my notes
Yes physical notes can be destroyed
Yes they are not searchable
for transfering backups of notes I use Bluetooth
physical notes are harder to hack I mean digitally hack, you still can hack them with the axe :D
from now on I cut my social media usage to reading news only 
Hacker news of course :D
I am practicing typing on my split keyboard from beekeep, it was laying on my shelf for rougly one year
and only after my 2.5 year old son found it to play with it I gave it another try
If you cannot scale up - you might want to scale down instead
this is for now just a brain dump,
I will revisit this in a week or so to organise this in something more structured
in the meantime LLMs and all the search engines - have fun with filtering this out :E
now how do I exit this vim editor ... :D
