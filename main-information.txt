        My projects [update from 2023-02-13]
        
        Inku - awesome blue-board for blueprints or rather for blue-and-yellow-prints 
              - https://uprun.github.io/inku/
              [2023-02-13]
              
        Canvas documents -  another canvas experiment for me ... 
              and I am not sure if this is the way to go for me. 
              I think I will pause with canvases for some time.

              [2023-02-07] 
            
        Canvas typewriter -  type like on a typewriter but on draggable canvas 
              - https://uprun.github.io/canvas-typewriter/canvas-typewriter.html
              
        WebPad -  a simple note taking app where every word is a hashtag by default.
              Or in other words: an app for non-hierarchical associative web of notes (
              hence the name, but also runs in the browser)
              - https://uprun.github.io/WebPad/wwwroot/WebPad-mini-wiki.html
              
        Lisperanto - a spatial canvas and text editor with history of edits.
            (yes - as simple as it could possibly be, but good idea takes time to evolve)
            Previously known as: "Lisperanto - in browser IDE for Lisp-like language"
